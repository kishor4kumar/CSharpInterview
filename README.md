Follow all .NET Framework Design Guidelines for both internal and external members. Highlights of these include:

	Do use camelCasing for member variables
	Do use camelCasing for parameters
	Do use camelCasing for local variables
	Do use PascalCasing for function, property, event, and class names
	Do prefix interfaces names with “I”
	Do not prefix enums, classes, or delegates with any letter
